				<h1>Welcome to Qatar</h1>
				<figure class= "fig1"><img src="emir.jpg"  class="image" alt=""><figcaption><em>Emir Of Qatar: Sheikh Tamim Al Thani</em></figcaption></figure>
				<p>Occupying a small desert peninsula that extends northward from the larger Arabian Peninsula, 
				it has been continuously but sparsely inhabited since prehistoric times. Following the rise of Islam, 
				the region became subject to the Islamic caliphate; it later was ruled by a number of local and foreign 
				dynasties before falling under the control of the Thani dynasty (Āl Thānī) in the 19th century. The Thani 
				dynasty sought British patronage against competing tribal groups and against the Ottoman Empire—which 
				occupied the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries—and in exchange the United Kingdom controlled 
				Qatar’s foreign policy until the latter’s independence in 1971. Thereafter the monarchy continued to nurture 
				close ties with Western powers as a central pillar of its national security. Qatar has one of the world’s largest 
				reserves of petroleum and natural gas and employs large numbers of foreign workers in its production process. 
				Because of its oil wealth, the country’s residents enjoy a high standard of living and a well-established system of 
				social services.</p>
				<p>Slightly smaller in area than the U.S. state of Connecticut, the Qatar peninsula is about 100 miles 
				(160 km) from north to south, 50 miles (80 km) from east to west, and is generally rectangular in shape. The national
				 animal of Qatar is Oryx. Camels can also very common in Qatar, they usually are freely roaming in the desert.</p>
				
				<p>Most of Qatar’s area is flat, low-lying desert, which rises from the east to a central limestone 
				plateau. Sand dunes and salt flats, or sabkhahs, are the chief topographical features of the southern 
				and southeastern sectors. Qatar has more than 350 miles (560 km) of coastline; its border with Saudi 
				Arabia is some 37 miles (60 km) long. There are no permanent bodies of fresh water.</p>

				<p>The climate is hot and humid from June to September, with daytime temperatures as high as 122 °F (50 °C). 
				The spring and fall months—April, May, October, and November—are temperate, averaging about 63 °F (17 °C), 
				and the winters are slightly cooler. Precipitation is scarce, with less than 3 inches (75 mm) falling 
				annually (generally in winter).</p>

				<p>Qatari citizens constitute only a small portion—roughly one-ninth—of the total population 
				today. Economic growth beginning in the 1970s created an economy dependent on foreign 
				workers—mostly from Pakistan, India, and Iran—who now far outnumber nationals.</p>
				<p>Qatar’s economic prosperity is derived from the extraction and export of petroleum—discovered 
				in 1939 and first produced in 1949—and natural gas. Before World War II Qatar’s population engaged in 
				pearling, fishing, and some trade (with little exception the only occupations available) and was one of
				the poorest in the world. By the 1970s, however, native Qataris enjoyed one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.</p>
				<p>Health care and medical services are provided free to all residents through government programs.</p>
